## MACHINE LEARNING ðŸ‘‡
**Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often
uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve
performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. In the past
decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective
web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.**

## MACHINE LEARNING TASKS ðŸ‘‡
**Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether
there is a learning "signal" or "feedback" available to a learning system:**

## SUPERVISED LEARNING: ðŸ‘‡
**The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs,
given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As
special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback:**

## SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING: ðŸ‘‡
**The computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training
set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.**


## ACTIVE LEARNING: ðŸ‘‡
**The computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances
(based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When
used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling.**

## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: ðŸ‘‡
**training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as
feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or
playing a game against an opponent.**

## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: ðŸ‘‡
**No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to
find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden
patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).**
