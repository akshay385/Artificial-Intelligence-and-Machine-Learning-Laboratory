## MACHINE LEARNING 👇
**Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often
uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve
performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. In the past
decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective
web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.**

## MACHINE LEARNING TASKS 👇
**Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether
there is a learning "signal" or "feedback" available to a learning system:**

## SUPERVISED LEARNING: 👇
**The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs,
given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As
special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback:**

## SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING: 👇
**The computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training
set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.**


## ACTIVE LEARNING: 👇
**The computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances
(based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When
used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling.**

## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: 👇
**training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as
feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or
playing a game against an opponent.**

## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: 👇
**No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to
find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden
patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).**

## INSTALLATION PROCEDURE 🛠️

## WINDOWS 🖥️
**Download the latest version of python from the link below ⬇️ for Windows** 💻

https://www.python.org/downloads/

__PYTHON 3.9.6__

## UBUNTU (i specially prefer Ubuntu 16.04 which is a "long term support") 💡
**follow these steps if you wish to install python on your ubuntu**
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get install python3.9
3. To install additional packages like **Pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, tweeststream, scipy**
4. Follow the below command for addittional packages
5. pip install package_name **(ex: pip install numpy)**

## SYLLABUS and PROGRAMS LISTS:- 📓

1. Implement A* Search algorithm.
2. Implement AO* Search algorithm
3. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
4. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
5. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
6. Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
7. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.
8. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.
9. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regressionalgorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
